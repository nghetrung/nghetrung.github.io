### NLP Assignments

My solutions for the assignments in [***COMP90042: Natural Language Processing***](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2020/subjects/comp90042) by University of Melbourne (2020).

The first one is about text preprocessing and classification on rumour data on Twitter. My task is to predict, given a tweet and its reactions, whether it is a rumour or not. I first need to create training, development and test partitions from the preprocessed events and convert the bag-of-words representation into feature vectors. After that, I implement two text classifiers: Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, tune the hyper-parameters of these classifiers and print the task performance for different hyper-parameter settings.

For the second assignment, I will be quantifying the similarity between pairs of words of a dataset using different methods with the word co-occurrence in the Brown corpus and synset structure of WordNet. Firstly, I will preprocess the dataset to filter out the rare and ambiguous words. Secondly, I will calculate the similarity scores for pairs of words in the filtered dataset using Lin similarity, NPMI and LSA. Lastly, I will quantify how well these methods work by comparing to a human annotated gold-standard.

### Potential Donators
My implementation and report of final year project in [***MAST90107: Data Science Project***](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2020/subjects/mast90107) by University of Melbourne (2020).

<br><br>
In this project, my team works with <a href="https://www.oaktreecapital.com/about">Oaktree</a> - an American global asset management firm specializing in alternative investment strategies. Our task was to deliver two requirements of our client:
<br><br>
<ol>
  <li>Develop tools (e.g. scripts, dashboards, applications) to better manage/monitor/analyse our data.</li>
  <li>Identify strategies to increase donations to Oaktree. For example, this could involve identifying the characteristics of people who raise most of the money for Live Below the Line.</li>
</ol>

## Dashboards
While working in banking industry (BIDV), as a Data Analyst, I built interactive dashboards for different purposes using Tableau 
### Paygate (Bill Payment)
BIDV Paygate is an online payment gateway system for Fintech partners linking e-wallets. The system provides APIs for authentication and banking payment services for third parties, e-commerce platforms, and public services.
My task is to build a dashboard displaying the performance of the system in terms of transaction volume and value. Using Tableau, I had created a Monthly KPI dashboard with three main time-series views: Month-to-date, Previous Month, and Year-to-date transaction volumn or value depending on which one users want to see using filter. Each view also shows Month-over-Month (MoM) and Year-over-year (YoY) percentage change. User can filter to see data for different providers, service types, banking channels and time periods. Click on the image below to see my full dashboard.

### Digital Customers
This dashboard includes animated running charts which show number of digital customers (customers who use digital service) through time. By looking at the dashboard, we can see the growth in number of customers in our digital services.

### RFM Analysis
As part of a Customer Analysis problem, I built a Customer Segmentation dashboard based on results of RFM analysis. The Tree Map segments customer into 6 groups based on Recency, Frequency and Monetary scores. It also serves as a filter across the whole dashboard. The Ternary chart represents each customer as an individual point with each corner represents RFM metric.
